        Camels live in the desert and have some amazing features.
        Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.
        Their humps let them store up to 80 pounds of fat which they can live off for weeks and even months!

        Chameleons are widely popular creatures known for their ability to change their skin colours.
        The most disquieting thing about chameleons is their eyes, which move independently in their sockets and thus provide a near-360-degree scope of vision.
        Chameleons are equipped with long, sticky tongues, often two or three times the length of their bodies.
